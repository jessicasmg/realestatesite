        <h1>About SMG Property</h1>
    </section>

    <main class="content">
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>SMG Property was founded by Shaul Gabbay over a decade ago with a simple mission: to provide quality, affordable housing in Aurora, Colorado. What started as a commitment to serve the community has grown into a portfolio of more than 150 apartments, all managed with the same care and attention that defined our earliest days.</p>
        <p>Our passion for this work comes from something deeper than business. We genuinely love seeing individuals and families move into one of our properties and feel safe, secure, and at home. That feeling, knowing that someone has found stability and comfort in a place we've provided, is what drives everything we do.</p>

        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>We keep things local and personal. All of our properties are located within a one-mile radius in Aurora, which means when you need maintenance or have a question, we're never far away. Our team can respond quickly because we're part of the same community you live in.</p>
        <p>We also believe in flexibility. We know that everyone's situation is different, which is why we accept <a href="section-8.html">Section 8 housing vouchers</a> and offer multiple payment options, including cash payments for those who prefer or need that option. Approximately one-third of our residents use Section 8, and we've built strong partnerships with local housing authorities to ensure a smooth, reliable process for everyone.</p>

        <h2>Our Team</h2>
        <p>Aurora is one of the most diverse cities in Colorado, and our team reflects that diversity. We know that for many people, especially immigrants and members of minority communities, it matters to work with a team that understands their experiences and can communicate in their language.</p>
        <p>Our staff handles the day-to-day work that keeps our properties running smoothly: showing available units, processing applications, coordinating maintenance, and being available when you need support. They're knowledgeable, responsive, and committed to making sure your experience as a resident is a positive one.</p>

        <h2>What We Offer</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Housing Options:</strong> We offer studios, 1-bedroom, 2-bedroom, 3-bedroom, and 4-bedroom apartments with monthly rent ranging from approximately $900 to $1,600.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Flexibility:</strong> We accept multiple payment methods, including online payments through our tenant portal, traditional checks, and cash payments.</li>
            <li><strong>Section 8 Welcome:</strong> We gladly accept <a href="section-8.html">Section 8 housing vouchers</a> and work closely with housing authorities to make the process seamless.</li>
            <li><strong>Responsive Maintenance:</strong> Our full-time staff addresses maintenance requests quickly, and we offer a 24-hour emergency line available 365 days a year.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://smgprop.appfolio.com/connect/users/sign_in" target="_blank">Tenant Portal</a>:</strong> Through our partnership with Appfolio, residents can pay rent online, submit maintenance requests, sign lease documents, and view their payment history, all in one convenient place.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>At SMG Property, we believe everyone deserves a safe, comfortable, and stable place to live. Whether you're new to Aurora, starting over, or simply looking for housing that fits your budget and lifestyle, we're here to help. We treat every resident with respect, respond to concerns promptly, and work hard to maintain properties where people are proud to live.</p>
