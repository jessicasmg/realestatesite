            <p class="intro-text">SMG Property was founded by Shaul Gabbay over a decade ago with a simple mission: to provide quality, affordable housing that helps people feel truly at home.</p>
            
            <p class="body-text">What began as a small commitment to serve the Aurora community has grown into a portfolio of more than 150 apartments, all managed with the same care, responsiveness, and attention that defined our earliest days.</p>
            
            <div class="pull-quote">
                For us, this work has never been just about buildings or leases. It's about people.
            </div>
            
            <p class="body-text">We take pride in seeing individuals and families move into one of our properties, knowing they've found a place that feels safe, stable, and comfortable. That feeling, when someone finally exhales and says "I'm home," is what drives everything we do.</p>

Our team responds quickly because we're part of the same community you live in. Your neighborhood is our neighborhood.</p>
